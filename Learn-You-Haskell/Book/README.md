Learn You a _Haskell_ for Great Good!
=====================================

_by Miran Lipovača._

This is my personal copy of “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!”, the prettiest
book for learning Haskell that I know of.

You can read the book [online](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) or [buy a
copy](http://nostarch.com/lyah.htm).

Description at learnyouahaskell.com
-----------------------------------

> Hey yo! This is Learn You a Haskell, the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which
> is the best functional programming language around. You may have heard of it.
> This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to
> try functional programming.
>
> The whole thing is completely free to read online, but it's also available in
> print and I encourage you to buy as many copies as you can afford!

> To contact me, shoot me an email to: bonus at learnyouahaskell dot com! You
> can also find me idling on [#haskell](irc://irc.freenode.net/haskell) where I
> go by the name BONUS.
