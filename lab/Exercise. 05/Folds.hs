-- EXERCISE
-- foldr is more general than foldl. Indeed, we can even implement foldl using foldr
-- HINT: We're going to be constructing a function, which we then apply to our initial value v.
-- We want the function to emulate what foldl f v xs would normally do.
-- id and (.) are going to be useful.
-- It mighto also help to think about, if f' = flip f, how you can transform
-- f' x (f' y v))
-- into
-- f (f v x) y
-- Use type holes - if you write _ in a place where you want an argument, you'll get an error explaining what the type
-- that's expected there is.

-- EXERICSE
-- And then implement factorial using it.
-- >>> fact 3
fact :: Nat -> Nat
fact = foldNat' multNat (Suc Zero)

-- EXERCISE
-- If Nats can be converted to "n times applications" via foldNat,
-- is it perhaps true that "n times applications" can also be converted to Nats somehow?
--
-- You can ignore this bit below if you want to - just assume the forall means "the passed function must be polymorphic over a"
-- START "forall explanation"
-- Usually when we have a polymorphic function, like id :: a -> a
-- the *caller* chooses what a will be - when I write id 'a', I instantiate a with Char, so id becomes id :: Char -> Char
-- However, here we will need our function to work for any a, and so we must *require* something of the caller -
-- that they provide a function working *for any* a - meaning *we*(the callee) can decide what a to apply it for.
-- As a further example, consider
-- f :: (a -> a) -> Bool
-- f g = g True
-- this does *not* compile - let's assume it did.
-- if we have
-- h :: Int -> Int
-- h x = x + 1
-- then the caller would be able to write f h, (as they pick what a is) which is not valid,
-- since h requires its argument and return types to be Int, and True :: Bool
-- instead
-- f :: (forall a. a -> a) -> Bool
-- f g = g True
-- compiles, and now the caller cannot do f h, since the passed h needs to work *for any* a, while h :: Int -> Int
-- END "forall explanation"
--
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat (\f x -> f (f (f x)))
-- Suc (Suc (Suc Zero))
iterateToNat :: (forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a) -> Nat
iterateToNat f = f Suc Zero

natToIterate :: Nat -> (a -> a) -> a -> a

type Natural = forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a

-- EXERCISE
-- Hey, if we can convert between Natural (the type argument to iterateToNat), now with a synonym) and Nat without losing information
-- wouldn't that mean that they are equivalent, and we can do the same things with both?
-- let's reimplement some of them, with Natural
-- These are called "church encoded" natural numbers - they're used to encode natural numbers, when the only thing you "have" is functions.
--
-- Here's some exposition:
-- As you saw in the iterateToNat example, these Naturals are essentially applying some function to some value a number of times.
-- The idea is that we represent the number n as applying a function f n times to a value v.
-- For example:
-- 0 is represented by \f v -> v
--
-- z is for zero
-- s is for suc
zero :: Natural
zero s z = z

-- 1 is represented by \f v -> f v
-- 2 is represented by \f v -> f (f v)
-- 3 is represented by \f v -> f (f (f v))
-- and so on
-- With this function, we need to somehow "add another f".
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat zero
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ suc $ suc zero
-- Suc (Suc Zero)
-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ suc $ natToIterate $ integerToNat 5
-- 6
suc :: Natural -> Natural
suc n = \s z -> s (n s z)

-- EXERCISE
-- We can also add these. Here we need to think about how to add f n times to another Natural.
-- Note that usually
-- add n m = n suc m
-- Would be ok as a definition, however, due to some constraints in how ghc works, is not accepted (resolved in ghc 9.2 with ImpredicativeTypes)
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) zero
-- Suc (Suc Zero)
-- >>> iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc zero)))
-- Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero))))
-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc (suc zero))))
-- 6
add :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural
add n m = \s z -> n s (m s z)

-- EXERCISE
-- Now multiply them
-- Somme comment wrt ImpredicativeTypes applies here (probably)
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) zero
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult zero (suc (suc zero))
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc zero))

-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc zero)))
-- 6
mult :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural
mult n m = \s z -> n (m s) z

-- Is the same true for lists? Is there some function type that is "isomorphic" to lists - you can convert
